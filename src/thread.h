     Since the registers are now dynamically allocated, we need to make
     sure not to refer to the Nth register before checking that it has
     been allocated by checking search_regs.num_regs.

     The regex code keeps track of whether it has allocated the search
     buffer using bits in the re_pattern_buffer.  This means that whenever
     you compile a new pattern, it completely forgets whether it has
     allocated any registers, and will allocate new registers the next
     time you call a searching or matching function.  Therefore, we need
     to call re_set_registers after compiling a new pattern or after
     setting the match registers, so that the regex functions will be
